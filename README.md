# Data-Science-Projects-Python
The following repository consists of Data Science projects / analysis using Python . 

# Min. Max. Temp. Analysis:
The following analysis aims at giving a clear picture of the temperature changes in given region of observation. The visual leverages the guidelines of effective visual design
and follows Cairo's principles of visual analysis. 

## STEPS FOLLOWED:
-- Required libraries for analysis are loaded in Jupyter notebook
-- The data in .csv format is read to a specified Dataframe using Pandas library present in Python
-- All dates are converted to DateTime format and Dates are converted to Day_of_the_Year
-- Dataset is considerably cleaned to suffice easy analysis without loosing any important data
-- Maximum and Minimum tempearaures are seperated out and mean is calculated using Numpy library present in Python
-- All the required subsets of original dataset is merged using Pandas to help plotting
-- Visual of Maximum and Minimum temperaures are plotted using "matplotlib" library present in Python

## CONCLUSION
From the visual we can see that on an average the maximum and minimum temperatues run a difference of 10degCelsius throughout the year. We can also see a huge temperature variation on some days in the year 2015 as compared to all the years from 2005. This visual might be helpful for further climate change study and we can use the same to draw many insightfull conclusions
